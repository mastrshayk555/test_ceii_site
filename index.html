    <h2>The Organization</h2>
    <p>Community Enrichment Initiatives Inc. (CEII) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation created in 2013
      to enrich the lives of those in need in our community through initiatives that promote personal
      empowerment, self-sufficiency and productivity. To accomplish our mission we fight hunger
      and poverty through short and long term sustainable initiatives that promote health and
      wellness, personal empowerment, education and self-sufficiency in the Wilmington community.</p>
    <p>We are governed by a volunteer Board of Directors who work as Project Managers for our
      various programs and projects. We leverage our resources and operationalize our service
      delivery through public/private collaborations with government, other non-profits, local
      businesses and teams of dedicated volunteers. We move forward with plans for programs and
      projects as resources and funds are available. Our current source of funds are donations and
      grants. A priority is to develop an income stream and generate revenue to pay ongoing
      operating expenses. In this way we create sustainable opportunities in our community and
      generate income to sustain our efforts.</p>
    <p>In addition to regular programs that CEII supports at the MLK
      Center, CEII has two major projects underway the:

        <p class="lead pad">I want to share a story about something that has been deeply meaningful to me. As a high
          school student, I volunteered at the Martin Luther King Community Center in downtown Wilmington, NC. Over
          time, I began to understand the pressing needs of the students, their parents, and the community itself. I
          realized that just a few additional resources could make a significant difference, but I was faced with many
          questions: Where would these resources come from? How could we use them most effectively?</p>
        <p class="lead pad">
          I saw the potential in my students and the possibilities for the center. With that vision in mind, I decided
          to contribute $2,000 from my summer job savings and appealed to the community to match my donation in order to
          enhance the programs at the Center.
        </p>
        <p class="lead pad">
          That effort led to the founding of the nonprofit Community Enrichment Initiatives, Inc(CEII). a year later. A
          dedicated board of volunteers came together with the mission of serving our community's needs and empowering
          individuals. The MLK Center, which was the initial inspiration for CEII, continues to be the heart of our
          efforts. Our mission remains focused on promoting personal empowerment, self-sufficiency, and productivity in
          our community.

        <h1 class="display-4 p-4">A Letter From Our Willowdale Farms Founder</h1>
        <p class="lead pad">After a full career as a Mechanical Engineer, I retired to Wilmington, NC to be closer the
          my
          Daughter's family and see my two grandchildren grow up and be a part of their lives.</p>
        <p class="lead pad">One of my retirement bucket-list items was to become a Master Gardener. My mother had a
          garden and it brought joy and longevity into her life. I completed the Master Gardener training
          at NC Cooperative Extension in New Hanover County and spread the information to our
          community. I wanted to do something to give back to the community where my family lives; so,
          I started the non-profit association Wilmington Green to create and maintain sustainable
          community gardens. Initially, my mission was to create placemaking opportunities for the
          garden participants to enrich their lives but I soon learned there was a greater need.</p>
        <p class="lead pad">Along the way, I was associated with Feast Down East when it organized the Cape Fear Food
          Council. One of our associate members was the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North
          Carolina. I learned just how bad food insecurity was in New Hanover County: there were over
          62,000 people who were food insecure and one out of every five children in New Hanover
          County under eighteen was food insecure. Food insecurity and hunger were more urgent needs
          than placemaking so we revised our mission to support our food insecure neighbors.</p>
        <p class="lead pad">One of our community gardens was installed at the Heart Center at the County Hospital. I
          learned our general nutrition was not good and the disastrous effect it had on our health- heart
          attacks, diabetes, cancer, hypertension and obesity. I expanded our mission to educate others
          about the benefits of eating healthier foods.</p>
        <p class="lead pad">In 2018 I merged Wilmington Green into Community Enrichment Initiatives Inc. (CEII) to
          benefit
          from their 501c3 nonprofit tax exempt status and for long term sustainability of the community
          gardens. Wilmington Green became a project of CEII and is now known as Willowdale Farms.</p>
        <p class="lead pad">We developed ten community gardens and the two acre Willowdale Farm. We have a full size
          commercial greenhouse to grow transplants for all of our community gardens. We have an
          outdoor kitchen to field wash and pack vegetables for distribution and to demonstrate healthy
          cooking and for tastings. We built a barn for more storage space.</p>
        <p class="lead pad">We assisted dozens of local schools and gardens with technical support and free transplants.
          We thrive because of our dedicated volunteers and community collaborations.</p>
        <p class="lead pad">My mom lived to be 94; and I think she would be proud of our work at Willowdale Farms. We
          work to “Build a Stronger Healthier Community”!</p>
